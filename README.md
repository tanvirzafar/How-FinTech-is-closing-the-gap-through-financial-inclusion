The current global situation has brought about changes in our daily lives. Several countries have implemented strict stay-at-home protocols, closing establishments, and businesses that are considered nonessential by the government. These changes have led many of us to transition to the digital space by using different online platforms as part of our day-to-day lives. 

As everyone is urged to stay home and follow strict safety procedures, most of us are left to use electronic systems to pay for utilities, insurance, groceries, food, and banking transactions. More and more companies are promoting cashless transactions and e-payments to keep everyone safe. Other financial services are also being offered digitally through financial technologies. 

Through FinTech, innovative solutions can give the majority of the population access to financial services that generally require face-to-face transactions. Not only that, everyone can now have access to these services that only the wealthier population can. FinTech is opening the doors of financial services to everyone. 

<b>FinTech promotes financial inclusion</b>

"Financial inclusion is the process of ensuring that individuals, especially poor people have access to basic financial services in the formal financial sector," Peter K Ozili noted in his <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338432774_Financial_inclusion_research_around_the_world_A_review">research</a> published in Forum of Social Economics. 

The paper also explained that "there is growing evidence that financial inclusion has substantial benefits for the excluded population, especially for women and poor adults in many countries, and policymakers in many countries have embraced financial inclusion as the key to economic empowerment and a solution to rising poverty levels."

Through the promotion of financial inclusion, FinTech can support billions of people around the world by giving them access to financial services by only using the internet. There is no need for complicated requirements; the unbanked and underbanked can now participate in the financial markets by using smartphones and their internet connection. 

"Fintech innovation driven by non-bank entities is progressively deconstructing the walls that have long surrounded the traditional financial and banking system and are causing a radical shift by challenging conventional value chain, business models, and market positioning. Significantly, fintech innovation is changing customers' experience and expectations by promoting a more client-centric and interactive approach to financial and banking services," a <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/projects/the-rise-of-financial-technology-fintech-innovation-and-the-future-of-the-banking-and-financial-system-a-comparative-analysis-of-the-fintech-legislative-and-regulatory-frameworks-in-the-united-stat/">research paper</a>, published by Stanford University, stated. 

Because of these, FinTech innovations by the non-bank entities, banks, and other regulated financial institutions are pressured to adopt newer technologies and develop similar capabilities bringing financial services closer to most of the population. Now, they can have easier access to a variety of financial products that are usually offered to the wealthier people. 

<b>Providing financial services through FinTech innovations</b>

The financial access given by non-bank entities has provided support to the underbanked and unbanked populations. Financial products and services, such as e-wallets and remittance services, have empowered communities to continue using FinTech driven innovations. 

Because of the support given to these products, banks, and other prominent players in the financial markets are looking at taking steps towards this direction and extending their services to almost everyone in the world. This means that lengthy banking transactions can be potentially cut down to shorter ones. This can also mean more opportunities for restricted financial services, such as investments. 

"Because of FinTech, everyone can now have access to investments and portfolio growth. These innovative technologies have allowed small amounts of money to earn interest in a short period. Those who can't afford to lock their funds for a long time can now participate in the investment markets," Andre Gold, Chief Executive Officer of <a href="https://prancegoldholdings.com/">Prance Gold Holdings</a>, an investment company fueled by FinTech, said.

Investments have always been associated with the wealthier population. However, FinTech has broken down this limitation by providing everyone access to such services. Investing through FinTech doesn't need large capitals, even smaller amounts of money can be used to grow assets efficiently.  

<b>Takeaway</b>

FinTech innovations have allowed non-bank entities to provide inclusion to the majority of the population by offering financial services. Because of this, big banks and traditional institutions are taking steps to provide better services through advanced technologies. Limited services, such as investing, are now readily available to everyone. "FinTech is providing access to the unbanked and underbanked through innovative platforms, giving them opportunities to access financial services and portfolio growth," Gerald concluded.
